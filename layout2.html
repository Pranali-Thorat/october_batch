              <h1>Product Information</h1>
              <p>
                     Many cosmetic products used in our daily life are made with the assistance of nanotechnologies.
                Among metal and metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) potentially present in cosmetics, 
                those containing titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are common ingredients added to obtain a sufficient sun protection.
                 The addition of silver and gold NPs is also mentioned to increase the antimicrobial and healing properties of some cosmetic formulations. 
                 To evaluate correctly the benefits/risks balance of these products, it is necessary to estimate the potential hazards associated to exposure 
                 levels as well as their fate once released in the environment.
                This information can only be obtained with analytical methods allowing the reliable characterization of NPs (e.g. size, size distribution, 
                composition and concentration).

                Many cosmetic products used in our daily life are made with the assistance of nanotechnologies.
                Among metal and metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) potentially present in cosmetics, 
                those containing titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are common ingredients added to obtain a sufficient sun protection.
                This chapter focuses on the analytical techniques available for metal and metal oxide NPs in cosmetic samples, 
                in particular electron microscopy, AF4 fractionation coupled to MALS and ICP-MS, and spICP-MS. Due to the complex matrix of
                cosmetic formulations, 
                a special attention is paid on the sample preparation step which is crucial for obtaining reliable results.
