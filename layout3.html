                     The addition of silver and gold NPs is also mentioned to increase the antimicrobial and healing properties of some cosmetic formulations. 
                     To evaluate correctly the benefits/risks balance of these products, it is necessary to estimate the potential hazards associated to exposure 
                     levels as well as their fate once released in the environment.
                     This information can only be obtained with analytical methods allowing the reliable characterization of NPs (e.g. size, size distribution, 
                     composition and concentration).
